# AI-driven IVR System

## Project Overview

Developed and deployed a real-time AI-driven IVR (Interactive Voice Response) and Voice Agent solution tailored for the ASEAN region over Twilio.

## Key Features

- Implemented, Deployed, and scaled the Faster Whisper Transcriber Service using WebSockets
- Migrated from Azure Speech with reduced latency and improved WER
- Implemented server-side buffering and end-of-speech detection
- Integrated real-time noise reduction to enhance transcription accuracy

## Technologies Used

- WebSockets
- FasterWhisper
- Ray
- AWS EKS
- Docker
- AWS Bedrock
- SileroVAD
- Locust
- Noise-Reduce
- Pedal-Board

## Implementation Details

The system was built with a focus on scalability and real-time performance. Key implementation details include:

1. **Real-time Transcription**: Utilized Faster Whisper for improved transcription accuracy
2. **Noise Reduction**: Implemented real-time noise reduction for better audio quality
3. **Scalable Architecture**: Deployed on AWS EKS for high availability
4. **Performance Optimization**: Reduced latency through server-side buffering
